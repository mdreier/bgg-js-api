# BoardGameGeek JavaScript API
JavaScript API for BoardGameGeek

## Why?
This is a support project for my attempt at a [BoardGameGeek app](https://github.com/mdreier/bgg-mobile) for mobile devices.

## What?
This JavaScript API is based on a reverse engineering of the (inofficial) API used by the [BoardGameGeek website](https://boardgamegeek.com/). To make my efforts reusable I split out the API into a separate package and will try to publish it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for reuse by other developers.

## What not?
This project is not official at all and in no way affiliated with BoardGameGeek, Geekdo, or BoardGameGeek, LLC.

The API used by this library is not official and therefor not stable. Changes on the BoardGameGeed side may break this library at any time and the timeframes for fixes depends fully on my motivation and free time. Therefor absolutely no guarantee is given for the functionality and usablility of this library.

## How?
TBD
